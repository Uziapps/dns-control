You can completely manage a domain from a web interface. It supports adding/modifying/removing A, MX, and CNAME records. All information is stored in a MySQL database. The interface(frontend) and command scripts(backend) are written completely in PHP(smarty for the templates). There is a separate interface for admins and users. The admin interface is for adding/removing/updating passwords for domains in the system. The user interface is for managing a domain.
